# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

Week 12 State Management in React
TASK 0:  Initialize the Recipe Sharing Application with Zustand State Management

Task Description:
Kick off the project by creating the foundational React application, integrating Zustand for state management, and setting up a simple interface for displaying and adding recipes.

Step 1: Set Up the React Project and Install Zustand
Step 2: Define the Recipe Store with Zustand
Create a Zustand Store:
Develop a store to manage the recipes with actions for adding a new recipe and initializing the list.
Step 3: Implement Recipe Components
Develop React Components:
RecipeList Component: Displays the list of recipes.
AddRecipeForm Component: Allows users to input and submit new recipes.
The above components should be under src/components directory
Step 4: Integrate Components in the App
Use Components in the Main App Component:
Import and use RecipeList and AddRecipeForm in App.jsx to display the functionality.

Deliverables:
React Project Setup: Project directory and initial setup files.
Zustand Store Code: The Zustand store configuration file.
Component Code: Source code for the RecipeList and AddRecipeForm components.

TASK 1: Enhancing the Recipe Sharing Application with Detailed Recipe Management
Objective: Expand the Recipe Sharing Application to include detailed recipe management features such as editing and deleting recipes, as well as viewing individual recipe details.

Task Description:
Build on the initial setup by adding functionality to view individual recipes, edit existing recipes, and delete recipes. This task introduces more complex state manipulations and interactions within the Zustand store and React components.

Step 1: Update the Zustand Store
Enhance the Store:
Extend your existing Zustand store to include actions for updating and deleting recipes. The actions should be named addRecipe, deleteRecipe,updateRecipe`.
Step 2: Create Components for Recipe Details, Editing, and Deleting
Develop New Components:
RecipeDetails Component: Displays detailed information about a recipe. This component should be accessible via a route that includes the recipe’s ID.
EditRecipeForm Component: Allows users to edit an existing recipe and submit changes.
DeleteRecipeButton Component: A simple button that, when clicked, deletes a specific recipe.
Step 3: Integrate Routing for Recipe Details
Setup React Router (if not already set up):
Implement routing in your application to handle navigation to different recipes’ details.
Use react-router-dom to set up routes that match the path to RecipeDetails.
Step 4: Testing and Integration
Test New Features:
Ensure all new components function correctly within the app. Test the edit and delete functionalities thoroughly to ensure state updates are handled properly across all components.
Deliverables:
Code Files: Include updated store configurations, new React components for recipe details, editing, and deleting.
Routing Setup: Changes made to support routing to different components.

TASK 2: Implementing Advanced Search and Filtering Capabilities
Objective: Enhance the Recipe Sharing Application with advanced search and filtering capabilities, allowing users to easily locate recipes based on specific criteria such as ingredients, recipe name, or preparation time.

Task Description:
Expand the functionality of your Recipe Sharing Application by integrating advanced search and filtering mechanisms. This will improve the user experience by making it easier to navigate and find specific recipes within the application.

Step 1: Update the Zustand Store for Search and Filtering
Enhance the Store:

Extend your existing Zustand store to include a search term and filtered results. Add actions to update the search term and compute filtered recipes based on this term.
Step 2: Create Search Input Component
Develop Search Component:

Create a SearchBar component that allows users to input a search term. This component should update the search term in the Zustand store on change.
Step 3: Display Filtered Results
Show Filtered Recipes:
Modify the RecipeList component to display recipes from the filteredRecipes array in the Zustand store instead of the complete list. Ensure it updates dynamically as the search term changes.
Trigger the filtering action whenever the search term is updated.
Step 4: Enhance User Interface for Filtering
UI Improvements:
Ensure that the search bar and the list of filtered results are displayed prominently in the UI.
Consider adding additional filters based on other criteria like ingredients or cooking time if relevant to your application’s data structure.
Step 5: Testing and Integration
Comprehensive Testing:
Test the search functionality extensively to ensure that it accurately filters recipes based on user input.
Check the responsiveness of the interface when dealing with a large number of recipes to ensure performance remains optimal.

TASK 3: Implementing User Favorites and Personalized Recipe Recommendations
Objective: Enhance the user experience in your Recipe Sharing Application by adding functionality for users to favorite recipes and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences and interactions.

Task Description:
Develop features that allow users to mark recipes as favorites and leverage user data to suggest personalized recipe recommendations. This addition will make the application more engaging and tailored to individual user tastes.

Step 1: Update the Zustand Store for Favorites and Recommendations
Enhance the Store:

Add a favorites array to the Zustand store to manage the user’s favorite recipes.
Implement actions in the store to add and remove recipes from favorites.
Optionally, add a mechanism to generate recommendations based on the user’s favorite recipes or other criteria.
Step 2: Create Components for Favorites and Recommendations
Develop New Components:

FavoritesList Component: Displays a list of the user’s favorite recipes.
RecommendationsList Component: Shows personalized recipe recommendations based on the user’s favorites or other criteria.
Step 3: Integrate Favorites and Recommendations into the UI
UI Integration:
Place FavoritesList and RecommendationsList components appropriately in the main application layout.
Ensure that users can easily add or remove recipes from their favorites and view recommendations seamlessly.
Step 4: Testing and User Feedback
Comprehensive Testing:
Test the functionality of adding and removing favorites extensively.
Evaluate the relevance and accuracy of the recommendations system.
Gather user feedback on the favorites and recommendations features to refine and improve them.
Step 5: Documentation and Final Adjustments
Final Documentation and Adjustments:
Ensure all new features are fully integrated and functioning as expected within the overall application.
Provide brief inline comments or notes explaining the logic behind the favorites and recommendations features.
